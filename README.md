# CarPriceCalculator
A simple WPF program that calculates average car price and on that it adds whatever profit margin percentage you want. This was built in mind for used cars price projection. This is a basic calculus example that you get top 3 of 
the expensive and 3 of the cheapest and one at random price and you calculate average price given the car criteria. Then when you want to sell that car you add in your targeted profit margin and it will give you a simple calculation
 of the projeted price. I will build on top of this a more complex system with maybe some interesting features.
